# Project name
BOSCore Polkadot Bridge
## Project Description
BOSCore project is an open-source blockchain project that pays close attention to the needs of developers and users, since 2019, BOSCore has achieved development milestones to build a custom implementation of the EOSIO codebase while maintaining compatibility with the main branch of EOSIO. 

Within days of the BOSCore (BOS) public blockchain going live, our developers had deployed the first IBC Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol for EOSIO. The IBC protocol enables interoperability for the transfer of tokens between BOSCore and EOSIO via relay nodes and decentralized light clients (bosibc) Smart Contracts coded in WASM, and uses a system of SPV and Merkle Tree Proof technologies.

To further advance our codebase, we developed Batch PBFT, a consensus algorithm achieving block finality speeds of 3-second and bench-marking 50 times faster with an insignificant overhead when compared to the default EOSIO consensus.

</p>

Since then, we have enabled the IBC systems HUB protocol and linked five public EOSIO based chains (BOSCore, EOS, Telos, WAX, and YAS), this allows the transfer of system and custom tokens along with transaction memo data over the network. This functionality enables application developers to build and deploy multi-chain DApps. 

We see advancements and innovation taking place in the ecosystem, that can lead to greater interoperability between different networks, and are keen to build a bridge linking BOSCore and EOSIO based parallel chains with Polkadot Parachains. Extending the functionality of bosibc so developers building multi-chain DApps can port their applications and leverage a more decentralized user-base spanning connected networks.

In summary, we will develop a bridge that connects the BOSCore IBC Network (Bridge Chain) via a Polkadot Parachain hosted bridge. We can complete the development in a timely manner to meet project milestones and are motivated to contribute to the ecosystem.

* The team's long-term plans and intentions with this project.  
Long term plans are to progress the project through the development and adoption of protocol standards that lead to unprecedented scalability for the development of blockchain-related digital economies. 

## Additional Information
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.
* What work has been done so far?  
Milestone 1 is completed with the submission of this application and publication of a medium article describing the open application for the project. 
* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?  
There are no teams who have already contributed to the project financially. 
* Have you applied for other grants so far?  
No other grants have been applied for this project
* Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?  
Yes, there are other bridge chain projects focused on staking and linking to other networks such as Cosmos, Ethereum, EOS, and Tendermint.  In contrast, this project-specific focus is on establishing interoperability. Having already established interoperability between four public chains (BOSCore, EOS, Telos, and Wax) you can experience BOSIBC today.  Extending this existing connectivity with a bridge to the Polkadot network would benefit the whole ecosystem, including other projects in development. Network interoperability, by definition, is communicating and working together.
